# Gallery AI Automation

## Lovable website

The editable recreation of the published Lovable website lives in
[`lovable-site/`](./lovable-site/). It is a responsive Vite/React frontend with
the agent carousel, workflow explanation, contact form, and Gallery AI
assistant.

```bash
cd lovable-site
npm install
npm run dev
```

A self-hosted, human-in-the-loop starter system for a gallery. Google Sheets is
the shared data hub, four n8n workflows are the agents, Ollama/Qwen 3 is the
local language model, and Gmail Drafts is the owner's review interface.

Client site: https://www.lemuseedumonde.com/gallery-ai

Cloud workspace: https://gallery-ai-production-d094.up.railway.app/home/workflows

The website in [`lovable-site/`](./lovable-site/) presents the four published
agents and links authenticated users directly to each production workflow.

Cloud deployment guide: [`CLOUD-DEPLOYMENT.md`](CLOUD-DEPLOYMENT.md)

The workflows are deliberately **inactive on import**. Configure and test each
one before activating it.

## Included

- `docker-compose.yml` — n8n, Ollama, persistent volumes, and model bootstrap
- `workflows/01-artist-onboarding.json`
- `workflows/02-opportunity-finder.json`
- `workflows/03-collector-assistant.json`
- `workflows/04-weekly-gallery-report.json`
- `config/sheets-schema.csv` — exact spreadsheet tabs and columns
- `config/google-form-fields.md` — form field contract and Google Forms option
- `OWNER-MANUAL.md` — non-technical operating guide
- `ENGINEER-RUNBOOK.md` — deployment, credential, testing, and rollback steps
- `RUN-ALL-LOCALLY.md` — one-command local stack and all-agent startup guide
- `scripts/build-workflows.mjs` — reproducibly generates workflow JSON
- `scripts/validate-workflows.mjs` — checks workflow structure and connections

## Quick start

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace every secret/default.
2. Run `make validate && make up && make import`.
3. Run `make doctor` to verify n8n, Ollama, and Qwen.
4. Open `http://localhost:5678` and create the n8n owner account.
5. Create the “Gallery AI Database” spreadsheet from `config/sheets-schema.csv`.
6. In n8n, create OAuth2 credentials for Google Sheets, Gmail, and Calendar.
7. Follow `RUN-ALL-LOCALLY.md` to test and activate the four agents one at a
   time.

## Safety properties

- Artist, collector, digest, and report content is created as a Gmail draft.
- Weekly report drafts are addressed to the owner and `victormascot@gmail.com`;
  the owner still reviews and sends them manually.
- Only short owner notifications are sent automatically.
- All imported workflows start inactive.
- Qwen is prompted to return JSON and not invent missing facts.
- Collector recommendations are filtered to `Status = Available`.
- Opportunity digests tell the owner to verify eligibility and deadlines at the
  source.
- Credentials are never included in this package.

## Practical limitations

- RSS URLs change. Agent 2 is configured with three feeds that were reachable
  during setup; verify eligibility and deadlines at the original source.
- Agent 3 is configured for the Gmail label `Collector Inquiry`.
- Google Forms has no native n8n trigger in this template. Agent 1 uses an n8n
  Form Trigger. To keep Google Forms, link it to a response Sheet and replace
  only the trigger with a Google Sheets Trigger.
- Local Qwen output quality depends on model size and hardware. `qwen3:4b` is
  installed, configured, and passed a local JSON inference test on this Mac.
- The workflows were imported into a local n8n 2.32.6 instance and connected
  to the configured Google Sheet, Gmail, and Calendar credentials.
